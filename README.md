# LINQPad Queries

This repository is a collection of linqpad queries to demonstrate prototyping ideas, learning frameworks and much more.

## About LINQPad

- LINQPad is not just for LINQ queries, but any C#/F#/VB expression, statement block or program.
- Reference your own assemblies and NuGet packages.
- Prototype your ideas in LINQPad and then paste working code into Visual Studio.
- Full support for C# 8 and .NET Core 3 in LINQPad 6.
- LINQPad also supports all the LINQ APIs in the .NET Framework, including LINQ to XML, PLINQ, Entity Framework and LINQ to SQL.
- you can still query in good old-fashioned SQL â€” even if your back-end is SQLite, Oracle, MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Images and bitmaps render as images and bitmaps, and types from Reactive Extensions and Dataflow fully animate.
- Dump any WPF or Windows Forms object and it will actually render.
